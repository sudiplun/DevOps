## Microsoft Azure

Azure provides a wide range of services for compute, networking, storage, databases, analytics, AI, machine learning, IoT, and more. Here, we'll focus on some fundamental and commonly used services.

### 1. VMs (Virtual Machines)

* **Purpose:** Azure Virtual Machines (VMs) provide **on-demand, scalable computing resources**. Just like AWS EC2, Azure VMs allow you to run virtualized operating systems (Windows, Linux, etc.) in the cloud, giving you full control over the operating system, applications, and configuration. They are the cloud equivalent of a physical server.
* **Core Concepts:**
    * **VM Image:** A template used to create a VM, containing a pre-configured operating system and often pre-installed software (e.g., Windows Server, Ubuntu, SQL Server). You can also create custom images.
    * **VM Size:** Determines the number of vCPUs, memory, and temporary storage capacity of the VM. Azure offers various VM series optimized for different workloads (e.g., general purpose, compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized).
    * **Managed Disks:** Azure's managed storage solution for VMs, simplifying disk management. You choose the disk type (e.g., Standard HDD, Standard SSD, Premium SSD, Ultra Disk) and size, and Azure handles the underlying storage infrastructure.
    * **Availability Sets/Zones:**
        * **Availability Sets:** Groups VMs to provide redundancy within a data center, protecting against planned maintenance and unplanned downtime by distributing VMs across different fault domains (physical server racks) and update domains (groups of VMs that can be rebooted together).
        * **Availability Zones:** Provides higher availability by distributing VMs across physically separate data centers within an Azure region, protecting against large-scale outages.
    * **Extensions:** Small applications that automate post-deployment configuration and management tasks on Azure VMs (e.g., custom script extension, anti-malware, monitoring agents).
* **Use Cases:**
    * Hosting web servers, application servers, and enterprise applications.
    * Development and testing environments.
    * Running specialized software or legacy applications that require specific OS configurations.
    * Hosting databases (if not using managed database services like Azure SQL Database).
* **Brief Practical Aspect:** You define the VM's image, size, network settings (VNet and NSG), and disk configuration. After deployment, you can connect to Windows VMs via RDP or Linux VMs via SSH.

### 2. Storage Accounts

* **Purpose:** An Azure Storage Account is a **centralized container that holds all of your Azure Storage data objects**. It provides a unique namespace for your data that is accessible from anywhere in the world over HTTP or HTTPS. It's the foundation for various types of Azure storage.
* **Core Concepts:** Azure Storage Accounts offer different services within them:
    * **Blob Storage (Binary Large Object):** For storing massive amounts of unstructured object data (text, binary data, images, videos, backups, archives).
        * **Container:** A logical grouping of blobs.
        * **Blob Types:** Block blobs (for most objects), Append blobs (for logging), Page blobs (for VM disks).
        * **Access Tiers:** Hot (frequently accessed), Cool (infrequently accessed), Archive (rarely accessed, long-term storage) for cost optimization.
    * **Azure Files:** For fully managed file shares in the cloud that are accessible via the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol or NFS. Can be mounted by cloud or on-premises deployments.
    * **Queue Storage:** For storing large numbers of messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world. Used for asynchronous messaging between application components.
    * **Table Storage:** A NoSQL datastore for structured, non-relational data, providing a fast and cost-effective way to store large amounts of data.
    * **Disk Storage:** The storage used for Azure Virtual Machine disks (OS disks and data disks).
* **Use Cases:**
    * Storing website assets, user-generated content, media files.
    * Data lakes for analytics.
    * Backup and disaster recovery.
    * Centralized logging.
    * Sharing files across VMs or on-premises systems.
    * Decoupling application components with message queues.
* **Brief Practical Aspect:** You create a storage account, choose its type (e.g., General-purpose v2 for most needs), and then create containers, file shares, queues, or tables within it. You manage access using Shared Access Signatures (SAS) or Azure Active Directory.

### 3. Networking (VNets, NSGs)

Azure Networking services allow you to connect your Azure resources, on-premises networks, and the internet.

#### A. VNets (Virtual Networks)

* **Purpose:** An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a **logically isolated network in the Azure cloud**. It enables your Azure resources (like VMs, App Services, Functions) to securely communicate with each other, with the internet, and with your on-premises networks. You define your own private IP address ranges, subnets, and routing.
* **Core Concepts:**
    * **Address Space:** The private IP address range you define for your VNet using CIDR notation (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`).
    * **Subnets:** Divisions of your VNet's address space. Resources within a VNet are deployed into subnets. Subnets enable logical grouping and security control.
    * **IP Addresses:** Public IP addresses for internet-facing resources, and private IP addresses for internal communication.
    * **Internet Gateway:** Although not a distinct resource like in AWS, outbound connectivity to the internet is automatically provided for resources with a public IP or via a NAT Gateway within a VNet.
    * **VNet Peering:** Connects two or more Azure VNets together, allowing resources in both VNets to communicate seamlessly as if they were in the same network.
    * **VPN Gateway / ExpressRoute:** Used to establish secure connections between your Azure VNets and your on-premises networks.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Creating a private, isolated network for your applications.
    * Implementing multi-tier application architectures (e.g., web, application, database tiers in separate subnets).
    * Extending your on-premises data center into the cloud (hybrid cloud).
    * Connecting different environments (dev, test, prod) in Azure.

#### B. NSGs (Network Security Groups)

* **Purpose:** An Azure Network Security Group (NSG) is a **virtual firewall** that filters network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure VNet. NSGs contain security rules that allow or deny inbound and outbound network traffic based on source/destination IP address, port, and protocol.
* **Core Concepts:**
    * **Security Rule:** Defines the traffic flow (inbound/outbound), priority (lower number, higher precedence), source/destination (IP address, IP range, Service Tag, Application Security Group), protocol, and port range, and whether to allow or deny.
    * **Association:** NSGs can be associated with:
        * **Subnets:** Rules apply to all resources within that subnet.
        * **Network Interfaces (NICs):** Rules apply only to a specific VM's network interface.
    * **Default Rules:** NSGs have default rules (e.g., allow VNet inbound/outbound, deny all inbound from internet, allow all outbound to internet) that can be overridden by user-defined rules.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Controlling access to VMs (e.g., only allow SSH from specific IP addresses).
    * Isolating application tiers (e.g., allowing web tier to talk to app tier, but not directly to database tier).
    * Securing specific ports for applications.
* **Brief Practical Aspect:** When you deploy a VM, you'll associate it with a VNet and a subnet. You then create an NSG and add rules (e.g., allow inbound traffic on port 80 for a web server) and associate it with the VM's network interface or its subnet.

### 4. Azure DevOps (CI/CD Pipelines)

* **Purpose:** Azure DevOps is a suite of development services that provides end-to-end support for the software development lifecycle. It's a comprehensive platform for managing projects, version control, automated builds, testing, and deployments.
* **Core Concepts:** Azure DevOps consists of several integrated services:
    * **Azure Boards:** For agile planning, tracking work, managing backlogs, and visualizing progress (Kanban boards, Scrum).
    * **Azure Repos:** Provides Git repositories for version control of your code (can also use TFVC - Team Foundation Version Control).
    * **Azure Pipelines (CI/CD):**
        * **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates the process of building and testing code whenever developers commit changes to the repository. It helps detect integration issues early.
        * **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automates the release of software to various environments (dev, test, staging, production) after successful CI.
        * **YAML Pipelines:** Define your CI/CD workflows as code using YAML files, enabling version control, reusability, and collaboration on pipeline definitions.
        * **Agents:** The compute infrastructure where your pipelines run (Microsoft-hosted agents or self-hosted agents).
        * **Stages, Jobs, Tasks:** Logical groupings for defining pipeline steps.
    * **Azure Artifacts:** For package management (e.g., NuGet, npm, Maven feeds) to share packages across teams.
    * **Azure Test Plans:** For managing manual and exploratory testing, and integrating automated tests.
* **Use Cases:**
    * Automating the build, test, and deployment of applications to Azure services (VMs, App Services, Kubernetes, Functions) or other cloud/on-premises environments.
    * Implementing DevOps practices within your organization.
    * Centralized project management, code versioning, and release orchestration.
    * Enforcing code quality and security checks throughout the CI/CD process.
* **Brief Practical Aspect:** You connect your code repository (Azure Repos, GitHub, etc.) to Azure Pipelines. You then define a YAML pipeline that specifies steps for building your application, running tests, and deploying it to your target Azure resources. Triggers can be set up so the pipeline runs automatically on code commits or pull requests.
