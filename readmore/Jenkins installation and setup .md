## Jenkins Installation and Setup

### 1\. Introduction to Jenkins

  * **What is Jenkins?** Jenkins is a self-contained, open-source automation server that can be used to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software.
  * **Why use it?**
      * Automates CI/CD pipelines.
      * Supports a vast ecosystem of plugins for integration with almost any tool.
      * Highly customizable and extensible.
      * Free and open-source.
  * **Prerequisites:** Jenkins requires a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run. Specifically, **Java 11 or Java 17 (LTS versions)** are recommended and supported.

### 2\. Installation Methods (Practical - OS Specific)

#### a. Installation on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1.  **Install Java (if not already present):**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre # Or openjdk-11-jre
    ```

2.  **Add Jenkins repository key:**

    ```bash
    sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    ```

3.  **Add Jenkins apt repository:**

    ```bash
    echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" | sudo tee \
      /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
    ```

4.  **Update apt cache and install Jenkins:**

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install jenkins
    ```

5.  **Start/Enable Jenkins service:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable jenkins
    sudo systemctl start jenkins
    sudo systemctl status jenkins # Verify it's running
    ```

#### b. Installation on Linux (CentOS/RHEL/Fedora)

1.  **Install Java (if not already present):**

    ```bash
    sudo yum update
    sudo yum install java-17-openjdk # Or java-11-openjdk
    ```

2.  **Add Jenkins repository:**

    ```bash
    sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
      https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
    ```

3.  **Import Jenkins GPG key:**

    ```bash
    sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
    ```

4.  **Install Jenkins:**

    ```bash
    sudo yum install jenkins
    ```

5.  **Start/Enable Jenkins service:**

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable jenkins
    sudo systemctl start jenkins
    sudo systemctl status jenkins # Verify it's running
    ```

#### c. Installation on Docker (Recommended for quick setup/testing)

1.  **Ensure Docker is installed.**

2.  **Pull Jenkins image:**

    ```bash
    docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts
    ```

3.  **Run Jenkins container:**

      * **Important:** Use a Docker **volume** to persist Jenkins data (`JENKINS_HOME`), otherwise all your configurations and jobs will be lost when the container is removed.
      * Map port `8080` for the web UI and `50000` for JNLP agents.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
      --name jenkins-server \
      --restart=on-failure \
      -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home \
      jenkins/jenkins:lts
    ```

      * **`jenkins_home`**: This creates a named Docker volume.
      * **Considerations:** Permissions for the mounted volume can sometimes be an issue if the Jenkins user inside the container (UID 1000) doesn't have write access to the host directory if you used a bind mount instead of a named volume. Named volumes typically handle this better.

#### d. Installation on Windows

1.  **Install Java (JDK 11 or 17):** Download the JDK installer from Oracle or OpenJDK distributions (e.g., Adoptium). Install it and set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.
2.  **Download Jenkins MSI Installer:** Go to the official Jenkins website ([https://www.jenkins.io/download/](https://www.jenkins.io/download/)) and download the Windows installer.
3.  **Run the Installer:**
      * Follow the wizard. You'll typically be asked for:
          * Installation directory.
          * Login credentials for the service account (use "Local System account" for simplicity, or provide specific user credentials).
          * Port for Jenkins (default 8080).
          * Java path (should auto-detect if `JAVA_HOME` is set).
      * Jenkins will be installed as a Windows service and started automatically.

### 3\. Initial Setup (Web Interface - Practical)

Once Jenkins is installed and running, you'll complete the setup via your web browser.

1.  **Access Jenkins Web UI:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://<your_server_ip>:8080`).

2.  **Unlock Jenkins:**

      * You'll see an "Unlock Jenkins" screen.
      * Locate the **initial admin password** from the path provided on the screen.
          * **Linux:** `sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword`
          * **Docker:** `docker logs jenkins-server` (look for "initialAdminPassword")
          * **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword`
      * Copy the password and paste it into the administrator password field. Click "Continue."

3.  **Customize Jenkins:**

      * You'll be prompted to "Install suggested plugins" or "Select plugins to install."
      * **"Install suggested plugins"** is usually the best choice for beginners, as it installs essential plugins for common CI/CD tasks. You can always add/remove plugins later.

4.  **Create First Admin User:**

      * After plugins are installed, you'll be asked to create your first admin user.
      * Fill in the required details (Username, Password, Full name, Email address). This will be your primary login.

5.  **Jenkins is Ready:**

      * Click "Save and Finish."
      * You'll see a "Jenkins is ready\!" screen. Click "Start using Jenkins."
      * You'll be redirected to the Jenkins dashboard.

### 4\. Post-Installation Configuration (Intermediate - Practical)

Now that Jenkins is up, you'll want to configure it for your specific needs.

  * **Plugin Management:**

      * Navigate to **Manage Jenkins \> Plugins**.
      * **Available plugins:** Browse and install new plugins (e.g., GitLab, Bitbucket, Kubernetes, Slack Notification).
      * **Installed plugins:** View, enable/disable, or uninstall existing plugins.
      * **Updates:** Check for and apply plugin updates regularly.

  * **Global Tool Configuration:**

      * Navigate to **Manage Jenkins \> Tools**.
      * This is where you tell Jenkins where to find tools like:
          * **JDK:** You can configure Jenkins to automatically install specific JDK versions or point to existing ones.
          * **Git:** Essential for version control. Jenkins usually pre-installs Git, but you can configure specific versions or point to your system's Git.
          * **Maven/Gradle:** If you're building Java/Kotlin projects.
          * **Node.js:** If you're building JavaScript/Node.js projects.
      * **Best Practice:** Use Jenkins' automatic installer for tools when possible, as it manages different versions for you.

  * **System Configuration (Manage Jenkins \> Configure System):**

      * **Jenkins URL:** Set the correct URL for your Jenkins instance (e.g., `http://jenkins.mycompany.com:8080`). This is crucial for notifications and external links.
      * **Number of executors:** Defines how many concurrent jobs Jenkins can run on the master node.
      * **Global environment variables:** Set variables accessible by all jobs (e.g., proxy settings).
      * **Email Notifications:** Configure an SMTP server for sending build status emails.
      * **Source Code Management:** Configure global settings for Git, Subversion, etc.

  * **User Management and Security (Manage Jenkins \> Security):**

      * **Authentication:**
          * **Jenkins' own user database:** Simple, built-in user management.
          * **LDAP/Active Directory:** Integrate with corporate directories for centralized user management (recommended for enterprises).
          * **OAuth (GitHub, GitLab, Google):** Allow users to log in with their VCS accounts.
      * **Authorization:** Defines what authenticated users can do.
          * **Matrix-based security:** Fine-grained control over permissions for users/groups globally or per project.
          * **Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy:** Granular control per project.
      * **Important:** Always secure your Jenkins instance. Use strong passwords, implement granular permissions, and restrict public access.

### 5\. Advanced Setup Considerations (Expert - Theory/Practical)

For production environments and larger teams, consider these advanced configurations.

  * **Scaling Jenkins (Master-Agent Architecture - Distributed Builds):**

      * **Theory:** The Jenkins master orchestrates builds and stores configurations, but it's best not to run actual build processes on the master itself. Instead, offload builds to **agents (or nodes)**. Agents are separate machines (physical, VMs, containers) that connect to the master and execute jobs.
      * **Benefits:**
          * **Scalability:** Run many jobs concurrently.
          * **Isolation:** Build environments are isolated from each other and the master.
          * **Resource Management:** Agents can have different hardware/software configurations.
          * **Security:** If an agent is compromised, the master is safer.
      * **Practical:**
          * **Adding Linux Agents (SSH):** In **Manage Jenkins \> Nodes**, create a new node, configure connection details (SSH credentials, remote root directory), and Jenkins will connect via SSH to launch an agent.
          * **Adding Windows Agents (JNLP/SSH):** Can use JNLP (Java Network Launching Protocol) for Windows agents or SSH for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environments.
          * **Cloud Agents (EC2, Kubernetes):** Use plugins (e.g., Amazon EC2 plugin, Kubernetes plugin) to dynamically provision and de-provision agents as needed in the cloud, optimizing resource usage.

  * **Backup and Restore:**

      * **Jenkins Home Directory (`JENKINS_HOME`):** This directory (e.g., `/var/lib/jenkins` on Linux) contains all your Jenkins configuration, job definitions, build history, plugin data, and user data. Back it up regularly.
      * **Strategies:**
          * **Simple Copy:** Stop Jenkins, tar/zip the `JENKINS_HOME` directory.
          * **Backup Plugins:** Use plugins like "ThinBackup" or "Backup Plugin" for automated backups.
          * **Volume Snapshots:** If Jenkins is running in a VM or container with persistent volumes, leverage underlying storage snapshot capabilities.

  * **High Availability (HA):**

      * **Theory:** For mission-critical Jenkins instances, you can set up HA to minimize downtime. This typically involves an active-passive setup with shared storage for `JENKINS_HOME` and a load balancer.
      * **Consideration:** Jenkins' built-in HA is limited, often requiring external solutions for true resilience.

  * **Security Hardening:**

      * **HTTPS Setup:** Always enable HTTPS for your Jenkins UI using a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache) or a servlet container like Jetty.
      * **Least Privilege:** Grant users and build jobs only the necessary permissions. Avoid giving `admin` privileges widely.
      * **Firewall Rules:** Restrict network access to Jenkins to only necessary ports and IP ranges.
      * **Regular Updates:** Keep Jenkins core and plugins updated to patch security vulnerabilities.
      * **Protecting Credentials:** Use the Jenkins Credentials Plugin to securely store sensitive information (passwords, API tokens, SSH keys) and inject them into builds without exposing them.
      * **Disable CLI over HTTP:** If not needed, disable `Inbound TCP agent protocol` for enhanced security.

  * **Monitoring Jenkins:**

      * **Internal Metrics:** Jenkins provides basic monitoring within the UI (e.g., build queues, system load).
      * **External Monitoring Tools:** Integrate Jenkins with tools like Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog, or your cloud provider's monitoring services to track performance, resource usage, and health of both the master and agents.
      * **Log Management:** Centralize Jenkins logs with a logging solution (e.g., ELK stack) for easier troubleshooting and auditing.

A well-installed and configured Jenkins instance forms the backbone of a robust CI/CD pipeline, enabling rapid and reliable software delivery.
